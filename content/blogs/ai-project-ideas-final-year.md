Are you a final-year CS or Engineering student looking for an impressive **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** project? You are in the right place!

Choosing the right project can be the difference between a good grade and a great career placement. In this guide, we have curated 7 cutting-edge AI project ideas that are not only challenging but also highly relevant in the 2025 tech landscape.

## 1. AI-Powered Resume Screener

Recruiters spend only a few seconds on each resume. An AI screener can automate this context.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Python (Spacy/NLTK)** for Natural Language Processing.
- **React/Next.js** for the frontend dashboard.
- **FastAPI** for the backend.

**Why this project?**
It solves a real-world problem (Hiring Efficiency) and uses NLP, which is a hot topic.

## 2. Smart Traffic Management System

Urban traffic is a nightmare. Using Computer Vision, you can optimize traffic light timings based on real-time vehicle density.

**Tech Stack:**
- **OpenCV** & **YOLO** for vehicle detection.
- **IoT Sensors** (optional).
- **Python** for logic.

## 3. Generative AI Code Assistant (Like Copilot)

Build a mini-version of GitHub Copilot that helps students write code snippets.

**How to build:**
- Fine-tune a small LLM (like TinyLlama) on code datasets.
- Build a VS Code extension or a Web Interface.

## 4. Fake News Detection System

With the rise of social media, misinformation is rampant. Build a classifier that detects fake news articles.

**Approach:**
- Use a dataset like LIAR or FakeNewsNet.
- Train a Transformer model (BERT/RoBERTa).

## 5. AI-Based Personal Fitness Trainer

An app that uses the camera to count reps and correct posture during workouts.

**Tech Stack:**
- **MediaPipe** (Google) for pose estimation.
- **Flutter** or **React Native** for the mobile app.

## Conclusion

The best project is one that solves a problem you care about. Start small, build a prototype, and then iterate.
